# signal_handling

A Spring boot application using Strategy pattern to implement diferent operation based on the signal received in the rest api call.

Since the Algo implementation is simulated and only System.out.println() statements are made, using log statement in the handle method to test if the correct handle method is being called. The tests can be improved when a proper implementation of the Algo class is available.
